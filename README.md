A very simple and tiny BuddyPress plugin for WordPress to provide a convenient link next to each user listed in the WordPress users administration dashboard page pointing to that user BuddyPress profile edit page. Useful if you use BuddyPress extended profiles and want to manage your users faster or edit their profiles (default templates from WordPress do not allow edits on the frontend from admins).

Works with BuddyPress 1.6 to 1.9 (should work with 1.3-1.5 as well but untested) and WordPress 3.3 and above (untested with earlier versions).

To install, download from Github and place plugin in WordPress plugin folder. Activate from WordPress plugins dashboard page and that's it.

 
####Deprecated

As of 2.0.0, [Buddypress](http://buddypress.org/) introduced enhanced features to edit user profiles from WordPress admin dashboard, thus making this plugin obsolete. It will be no longer updated or supported.
